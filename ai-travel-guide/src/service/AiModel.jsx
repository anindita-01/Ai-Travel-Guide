Explore food courts in casinos.  Bring your own water and snacks.\n*   **Gambling:**  If you gamble, set a strict limit and stick to it.  Consider it entertainment money, not an investment.\n*   **Flexibility:** Be open to changing your plans based on deals and opportunities that arise.\n*   **Hotel Location:**  Consider hotels slightly off the main Strip for better prices.\n*   **Free Activities:** Las Vegas offers many free activities: Fountain shows, botanical gardens, street performers, etc.\n*   **Show Tickets:** Book shows in advance for better prices. Look for discount tickets at booths on the Strip (but be wary of timeshare pitches).\n\nThis JSON provides a comprehensive starting point for planning a memorable and affordable Las Vegas trip!  Remember to check prices and availability closer to your travel dates. Have fun!\n',
